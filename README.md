# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

In this challenge I refactored code to:

  Find semantic HTML elements

  Find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

  Find accessible alt attributes for images

  Find the heading attributes fall in sequential order

  Find a concise, descriptive title

### Observations

  I found the HTML elements were arranged in a logical structure


#### Changes Made

  Ordered the h2 elements above the h3 elements in the css file

  Changed the title of the HTML document to horiseon social solution services

  Added an id element before the search optimization class element
